# Wiper Control System
## Abstract

Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots.

In this proect we will build manually controlled wiper control system. We built a wiper control system using STM32F4 Discovery board. Here we use builtin button and LEDs to operate or visualize the project.We will control onboard four LEDs of STM32F4 discovery board with a push button.

### The working of motor is visualized in terms of LED action in STM32F4 - Discovery

## Features
-   __Step-1:__ The wiper control system becomes active on ___Hold of Button___ or 2 seconds and Red LED will ON indicating system is ON.
-   __Step-2:__ The system has 3 power levels (i.e, speed of motor in real world), we use (1, 4, 8)Hz as freuency levels used to visualize via LED.
    * When the system ___key press-1___(i.e, the push button is pressed once) the Blue, Green and Orange LED's come ON one at a time with the set frequency of 1Hz
    * When the system ___key press-2___(i.e, the push button is pressed twice) the Blue, Green and Orange LED's come ON one at a time with the set frequency of 4Hz
    * When the system ___key press-3___(i.e, the push button is pressed thrice) the Blue, Green and Orange LED's come ON one at a time with the set frequency of 8Hz
-   The sytem will go back to repeat step-2  when ___key press-4___ 
-   The wiper control system becomes inactive on ___Hold of Button___ or 2 seconds and Red LED will OFF indicating system is OFF.

## Controlling LEDs with Push Button STM32F4
In this project, weâ€™ve built a wiper control system using STM32F4 Discovery board. Here we use builtin ___button___ and ___LEDs___ to operate or visualize the project.We will control onboard four LEDs of STM32F4 discovery board with a push button. As you can see in the figure shown below a blue color push button is available along with four user LEDs.

## Components and Software required
-   [STM32F4 - Discovery](https://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/435284/STMICROELECTRONICS/STM32F4DISCOVERY.html) - Allow users to develop audio applications easily. It includes an ST-LINK/V2-A embedded debug tool, one ST-MEMS digital accelerometer, one digital microphone, one audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs, push-buttons, and a USB OTG Micro-AB connector.Specialized add-on boards can be connected by means of the extension header connectors.
-   [STM32 Cube IDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) -  STM32CubeIDE is an all-in-one multi-OS development tool, which is part of the STM32Cube software ecosystem. STM32CubeIde Board PhotoSTM32CubeIDE is an advanced C/C++ development platform with peripheral configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debug features for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors. 
-   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications
-   [LED]() - A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it
-   [Button]() - A push-button (also spelled pushbutton) or simply button is a simple switch mechanism to control some aspect of a machine or a process
-   [Eclipse Embedded CDT](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.embed-cdt) - It is a plug-ins allow to create, build, debug and in general to manage Arm & RISC-V projects (executables and static/shared libraries, in both 32 and 64-bit versions) with the Eclipse IDE.
-   [xPack Qemu](https://xpack.github.io/qemu-arm/#benefits) - xPack QEMU Arm is a fork of the public open-source QEMU project, customised for more support of Cortex-M cores, and a better integration with the GNU Arm QEMU Debugging plug-in.

## How the project works
1.  __Ignition Key Position at ACC:__ The Red LED is ON, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs
2.  __Wiper ON:__ On press of the user input, Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency, The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz
3.  __Wiper OFF:__ The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts next press onwards as mentioned in step 2
4.  __Ignition Key Position at Lock:__ The Red LED is OFF, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs

## Working when ON
|Key Press - 1|Key Press - 2|Key Press - 3|
